# Development Practices

This book is an introduction for the new developer to common development practices.

* Asking technical questions
* Pair programming
* Debugging
* Agile planning
* Doing research
* Speaking about technical topics
* Critiquing code and accepting critique
* Whiteboarding
* Writing documentation

Instead of the terms _junior developer_ and _senior developer_, I try to use _learner_, _practitioner_, and _mentor_ for skill levels. These terms are more accurate and lack negative connotations.
